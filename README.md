# 🎉 Event Management System – Salesforce Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Managing events manually often leads to missed registrations, confusion in resource allocation, and difficulty in tracking participants or generating reports.  
This project aims to build a **Salesforce-based Event Management System** that streamlines the entire process of organizing events — from registrations to reporting.
