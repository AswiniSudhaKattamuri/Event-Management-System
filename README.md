# 🎉 Event Management System – Salesforce Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Managing events manually often leads to missed registrations, confusion in resource allocation, and difficulty in tracking participants or generating reports.  
This project aims to build a **Salesforce-based Event Management System** that streamlines the entire process of organizing events — from registrations to reporting.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Event organizers face challenges in handling registrations, communicating with participants, tracking sponsors, and monitoring resources. Without a centralized system, it becomes difficult to manage event operations effectively.  

The objective is to **design and implement a Salesforce CRM solution** that enables efficient event planning, participant management, and performance tracking through automation and dashboards.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Create and manage multiple **events** (date, venue, type, capacity).  
- Allow **participant registration** and track details in Salesforce.  
- Send automated **confirmation emails and reminders** for events.  
- Maintain records of **sponsors and resources** allocated per event.  
- Build **reports and dashboards** for event performance insights.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
1. **Event Creation & Management**  
   - Store event details: name, type, venue, capacity, and dates.  

2. **Participant Registration**  
   - Capture registrations as Leads/Contacts.  
   - Track status: Registered, Confirmed, Attended.  

3. **Automated Communication**  
   - Confirmation emails upon registration.  
   - Reminder notifications before the event.  

4. **Resource & Sponsor Tracking**  
   - Assign resources like halls, food, logistics.  
   - Track sponsor contributions for each event.  

5. **Reports & Dashboards**  
   - Total registrations vs capacity.  
   - Event revenue and sponsor contributions.  
   - Participant demographics and attendance.
